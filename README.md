Features I Tried 
* Transition  with page loading 
* Basic Navbar with search button linking to search field and working hyperlinks
* Carausel Style Album covers exploring hover
* Aside Queue with independent scrolling
* Flexbox to align icons and resusing it with classes
* DropDown Menu in Superhits and Queue Section
* Playpause button with changing the image in label when checkbox checked or not to make it look functional
And so many transition and little things to practise the properties and selctors of css
AND it DYNAMIC to screen size !!
